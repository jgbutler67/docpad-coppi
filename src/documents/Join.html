				<h3>
	New Members</h3>
<p>
	If you are interested in joining Squadra Coppi, we strongly encourage you to come out and get to know the team to determine if we are the right fit for your racing goals. The best way to do this is to attend team rides and social functions. If after spending time with us, you are committed to joining Squadra Coppi, the next step is to <a href="/contact/">contact</a> the Membership Coordinator to learn the process and requirements for applying to join the team. Prospective members will need to complete at least three USA Cycling-sanctioned races prior to applying for membership.</p>
<h3>
	Renewing Members</h3>
<p>
	Membership is renewed on an annual basis at the beginning of the calendar year by paying dues, renewing your USA Cycling license, and buying one new team jersey with the current sponsors. In order to renew, members must have attended club rides and social functions, volunteered for the team&rsquo;s races, and raced in USA Cycling-sanctioned races in the prior year.</p>
