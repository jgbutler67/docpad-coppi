The ride leaves arlington at a warmup pace.  The pace remains warm up for the first 16 miles until the turn onto Tuckerman.  From there, the speed picks up.  At miles 23 and 24.5 there are options to shortcut and rejoin the group if you do not want to keep pace with the lead group.  At mile 35 there is a regroup point at the top of Old Anglers, at the entrance to the Park.  From there, the ride becomes a rotating paceline for most of Clara Barton, with a final sprint as you approach Georgetown. 
The ride is open to anyone, but please expect speeds ranging from 16-18mph during warmup, 20-25 mph for much of the ride, and occassionally faster during some of the more challenging sections. 
The team will make an effort to help any new riders with directions and instructions, but this is not a "no drop" ride.
