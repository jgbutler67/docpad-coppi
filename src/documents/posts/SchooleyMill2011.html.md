	As the MABRA Super8 Cyclocross Series heads into the home stretch, the attention has shifted to Howard County, Maryland, home of the two back-to-back races known as HoCo2XCX. &nbsp;Though no longer on the same weekend, Schooley Mill CX (Nov 13) and Rockburn CX (Nov 20) still hold a fond place in local racers&#39; hearts, including the cyclocrossers of Squadra Coppi.</p>
<p>
	At Schooley Mill, Sarah Crosskey was the top Coppi finisher on the day, storming to 2nd place in the Womens 4 field in her first cyclocross race of the year. Sarah was clearly unfazed by spending all of October away on travel, leading our own <a href="http://unholyrouleur-jim.blogspot.com/">Unholy Rouleur</a> to describe her as "just a bomber, swooping in occasionally to help the leaders destroy whatever field she is in." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Also telling us not to call it a comeback was Jon "Baron Von" Burns, who succumbed to pre-race heckling via email, Twitter, and Facebook and lined up for the Masters 3/4. &nbsp;The race left him a happy wreck. &nbsp;Let&#39;s let the Unholy Rouleur tell the tale again: &nbsp;"Burnsie&#39;s face was amazing, showing equal parts&nbsp;suffering, enthusiasm, and disorientation that looked like he&#39;d taken&nbsp;in too many terrain features in too short a time period." &nbsp;He may or may not have been bleeding after the race. &nbsp;Or maybe that was the Unholy Rouleur himself. &nbsp;Experts&#39; opinions differ. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Less dramatically (but much, much closer to the front of the race), Ryan Newill continued his stealth campaign of climbing the Masters 3/4 ladder with a 14th place finish, while Mark "Mr. Smooth" Skubis slotting in at 25th. &nbsp;Adam "Turbodiesel" Austin <a href="http://iamabikeracer.blogspot.com/">learned some stuff</a>&nbsp;in his race and has subsequently pronounced that while, you know, <em>riding</em> his bike isn&#39;t his thing, racing it really is. &nbsp;Chris Grengs clearly also loves racing, enough to hit that atrociously early 8:30 start for the Cat 4 race each week, and Schooley Mill was no exception.</p>
<p>
	Jake Thompson gave himself a <a href="http://scottsrightofway.typepad.com/scotts_rightofway/2011/11/schooley-mill-cyclocross.html">"stomach of anger"</a> in the Junior 15-18 race, as a late rolled tubular cost him a shot at the top steps of the podium. &nbsp;He rallied for 3rd, but was motivated enough to line up (on dad&#39;s full carbon bike with Zipp wheels, no less) in the Men&#39;s 3/4 "Killer B" field along with Brad Evans and Eric Blomquist. &nbsp;Blomquist, racing in Coppi blue for the first time, got right into the team spirit, working together with Der Jake to move from around 30th at mid-race to 23rd (Thompson) and 24th (Blomquist) by the finish. &nbsp;(Blomquist had already proven his value to the Azzurri earlier in the day by driving injured reserve member Rich Elder out to the race so he could heckle properly from a primo spot by the barriers.) &nbsp;Evans faded a bit after a strong start, but rallied for 8th to keep climbing the Super8 Series standings.</p>
<p>
	"Papa" Scott Thompson picked up 13th in a stacked 45+ Masters field, while Jim McNeely continued to make his life unnecessarily difficult by racing an overgeared, heavy mountain bike in the "45+ is Stacked? Ha! Come Over Here If You Want To See Stacked" Singlespeed class. &nbsp;While we&#39;re on the topic of stacked fields, Dave Pedersen apparently likes the weekly beating doled out in the Elite 35+ field, and Andrew Welch proudly flew the Coppi flag for 15th in the Pro/1/2/3 race, which was again dominated by Joe Dombrowski and Wes Schempf.</p>
