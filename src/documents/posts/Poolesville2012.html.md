Saturday&#39;s Poolesville High School Road Race featured a good showing for Squadra Coppi/Vapiano USA riders.&nbsp; The Queen of the Mid Atlantic Classics, the Poolesville course features a feared, notorious, and eagerly awaited 1 mile stretch of gravel road on top of 9 miles of deceptively tough classic Maryland hills.&nbsp; The course lends itself to breakaways and wins by strong men and women.</p>

		In the morning races, new Coppi James DiFilippi continued his string of top places, taking 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;in the Cat 5 race.&nbsp; We look forward to seeing James bring his power and finishing kick to the Cat 4 team very soon.&nbsp; In the only Masters race of the day, the combined 45+ and 55+, Dave Wilson was in the day&rsquo;s big break, with Dan Klaussen and James Bellora working to control the pack.&nbsp; Dave&rsquo;s break was caught but he still finished 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>

		Long time Coppi strong man James Hibbs scored big in the afternoon&rsquo;s Cat 3 race.&nbsp; After some mid-race help from 2011 Coppi President Mark Skubis, James made his way into the winning break with 3 to go.&nbsp; James took the chance on the long &ldquo;sprint&rdquo; and drove to the line for the last 400 meters, holding off two of the three of his remaining breakaway companions to take 2<sup>nd</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kosta Tombras, Bill Cusmano, and Kimani Nielsen came in 13, 15, and 16 in the trailing pack.</p>

		The Cat 4 team embodied the Coppi ethos of&nbsp;<em>Vincere Insieme</em>&nbsp;(winning together) placing 5 in the top 20.&nbsp; The team rode well to help protect an early break that contained Chris Grengs (little known fact, Chris was Minnesota state junior champ) who was their &ldquo;A&rdquo; candidate for the race.&nbsp; Once the break was caught on the second lap, the boys rode together, delivering Chris to 6<sup>th</sup>, with recently upgraded from Cat 5 Mike Russo taking 12<sup>th</sup>, Rob Eom 18<sup>th</sup>, Eric Blomquist 19<sup>th</sup>, and Jeff Sanders 20<sup>th</sup>.</p>

		Pro photog Jay Wescott, still on the mend from hip surgery, wasn&#39;t racing in Coppi blue but still proved himself number 1 with a camera. &nbsp;Jay brought his big giant lens and supplied us with some great action shots.&nbsp; Check him out at&nbsp;<a href="http://jaywestcott.photoshelter.com/gallery/2012-05-12-Poolesvile-RR/G0000ldBVu3WY95M" target="_blank">http://jaywestcott.<wbr>photoshelter.com/gallery/2012-<wbr>05-12-Poolesvile-RR/<wbr>G0000ldBVu3WY95M</wbr></wbr></wbr></a></p>
