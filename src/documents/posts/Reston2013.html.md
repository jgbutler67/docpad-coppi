Michael Russo and Brian Mattern lined up in hot and humid conditions, but were thankful that the morning rain was gone and the road was dry.  Things started off fast, when Andy Flemming (HPC) attacked from the offical's whistle and the field charged after him.  Russo sat in near the front and made a move on a mid-race prime lap, riding away for 2 laps before rejoining to recover.

The hot, humid conditions and the accordian effect at the back of the peloton on Reston's technical course claimed many a strong rider; unfortunately, despite fighting hard, this included Brian.  Russo took 6th in the field sprint.
