	On Sunday October 30<sup>th</sup>, a sizeable contingent of the Squadra Coppi &ldquo;Azzuri Sporca&rdquo; made the trip to Severna Park, Maryland for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year of Kinder Cross, which is part of the new &ldquo;Sportif Cross Cup.&rdquo;&nbsp; Despite the rain/snow of Saturday, the course was fairly dry with&nbsp;three VERY notable exceptions including one big puddle that grew over the course of the day.</p>
<p>
	Taking a short break from his usual entry in the 35+/45+ 123, Scott Thompson lined up in the 3/4 &nbsp;35+ along with up and comer Adam Austin.&nbsp; Scott reports that with no series points and a late registration, he started with number 253, somewhere in the 4 or 5<sup>th</sup> row.&nbsp; The course had LOTS of turns which worked well for him and he was able to rely on handling and guile where his power is a little lacking.&nbsp; After making his through the field, Scott finished&nbsp;8<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;overall, though&nbsp;results breaking out the 45+ subgroup weren&#39;t available at the race and Scott&rsquo;s place in that group isn&rsquo;t yet clear.</p>
<p>
	In the Men&rsquo;s cat 3/4 race, 14 year old super junior Jake Thompson, recently upgraded to Cat 3, lined up with Coppi&rsquo;s own killer-B super duo -- Brad Evans and Kimani Nielsen -- and freshly minted although not yet officially announced secret Coppi Eric Blomquist (welcome Eric!).&nbsp; Also with no series points, they were all starting in the thick of the scrum.&nbsp; Jake barely survived a crash in the first 100 yards, running over someone&rsquo;s carbon wheel, while Brad and Kimani flowed to the right around the crash.&nbsp; Jake rode well and was knocking on top 10 when he hit a hidden hole in a deep, cold puddle which endo&rsquo;d him into the muck.&nbsp; He ran to the pit with a bent shifter, which lost him more spots than the crash.&nbsp; He chased back for the next&nbsp;two laps and passed a few more people, finishing 20<sup>th</sup> with Eric hot on his heels.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Kimani went from the complete back to the front chase group.&nbsp; The series leader was way off the front, taking advantage of his front row starting position.&nbsp; Despite also taking a mid-race dip in the muddy pond, Kimani rallied and triumphed over the small chase group to finish 3<sup>rd</sup>. Brad, claiming to lack power, used his New England upbringing super powers to stay just a few meters behind Kimani&rsquo;s chase group for&nbsp;seemingly the entire race.&nbsp; After bridging to the group once, Brad trailed off in the last two laps but finished with a strong 6<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; Eric was right with Jake at the finish, near 21<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Starting&nbsp;one minute behind the 3/4 , Rookie junior Luke Klaussen lined up in the 15-18 race.&nbsp; He started great and was leading after the first lap but then had a hard fall on a tricky off-camber muddy section and lost some spots.&nbsp; He rallied, however, and finished on the podium at 3<sup>rd</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In the premier event of the day, Coppi&rsquo;s own recent transplant from California, Dave Pederson, lined up with a packed field of Cat 1s in the Elite 35+ race, including former national champions and ex-pros.&nbsp; Dave battled well and was beside himself with the joy of riding in 40 degree water and mud instead of the warm dry climes of California (we&rsquo;re not sure he&rsquo;s quite sane).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Next week&hellip;.a return to the MABRAcross Super 8 series and the fabled Lilypons of the Ed Sander Memorial race.</p>
