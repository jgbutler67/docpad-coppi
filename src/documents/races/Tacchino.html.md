Opening race in the Super 8 Series, the Tacchino is back and better than ever!  The course will feature rolling grass fields, gravel, two dirt track sections, numerous off-cambers, and a spectator-centric layout that encourages tifosi to take in the race while enjoying a beverage, a Belgian sausage, and a funk band.  It's hosted at Rosaryville State Park, a perfect outdoor location with a playground, over 12 miles of rolling singletrack trail, and spectator pavillions, conveniently located 15 minutes East of Washington D.C.
