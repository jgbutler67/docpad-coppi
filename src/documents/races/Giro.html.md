Directions

Make a right onto S/Old Hundred Rd.  Drive for serveral miles to the T-intersection at Barnesville road.  In order to keep traffic off of the course, the officials have asked that you take a right on Barnesville, and then a quick left on 109 Beallsville road.  Continue for .8 miles and take a left on Sellman Road.  Continue for .6 miles and take a left on Peach tree.  The Barnesville School will be one mile ahead on the left.
