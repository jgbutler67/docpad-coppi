Squadra Coppi is proud to have <a href="http://www.vapianointernational.com/vapiano/">Vapiano USA</a> as our title sponsor for the 2012 cycling season. &nbsp;The Squadra Coppi/Vapiano USA team has been visible at the front of races all over the Mid-Atlantic so far this season. &nbsp;As longtime host to our monthly team dinners at its <a href="http://www.vapianointernational.com/vapiano/locations/us-locations/us-locations.html">Ballston location</a>, Vapiano was already a great fit with Coppi, combining fun and quality food in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>

	The 2012 sponsorship also builds on Vapiano's title sponsorship of the 2011 Giro di Coppi road race and its support of the 2011 Tacchino Ciclocross. &nbsp;In 2012, Vapiano has played host to regular happy hours after the Arlington <a href="http://squadracoppi.com/events/ride/contes_hill_ride">Tuesday Night Hill Ride</a> organized by another Squadra Coppi sponsor, <a href="http://freshbikescycling.com/">Freshbikes</a>. &nbsp;With great food and a comfortable outdoor patio dining area, Vapiano has been the perfect place to refuel after a challenging workout on the hills of north Arlington.</p>

	About Vapiano:</p>
<p>
	With its innovative “fresh casual dining”-concept Vapiano defined a new category of food service. It combines elements of “fast casual“ and “casual dining“ and enables guests to individualize their stay at Vapiano at the highest level. Quality, freshness and transparency are the base of the restaurant‘s concept. No matter if pasta, pizza, sauces or dressings – the food is handcrafted daily at the restaurant and then freshly prepared a la minute in front of the guests. All that, combined with fair prices and Mediterranean ambiance, make up the success of Vapiano since the opening of the first restaurant in Hamburg in 2002. The concept quickly expanded within Europe, the USA, the Middle East, Mexico and South-East Asia. The brand is still growing and expanding. Currently, Vapiano runs 100 restaurants in 25 countries, thereof more than 40 in Germany.</p>
